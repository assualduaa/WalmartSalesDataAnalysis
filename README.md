# WalmartSalesDataAnalysis

🎯 Purpose

This dataset was designed to analyze Walmart’s weekly sales performance across multiple stores, departments, and time periods — while factoring in external influences (like weather and economy) and internal strategies (like discounts and holidays).

So, the goal is to answer:

“What factors drive sales performance at Walmart stores — and how can we forecast or improve them?”
